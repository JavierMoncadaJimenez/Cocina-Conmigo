# Cocina-Conmigo
This is my Higher Technician in Multi-platform Applications Development project. This is an Android application. 

In this application the user can upload the recipes and view and comment on the recipes as uploaded by other users.

These recipes are stored in a Firebase database (this database is not in use and therefore the application can't work properly).

The project has several layouts for logging into the application, uploading a recipe, commenting on the recipe and viewing the recipe. These layouts are created using XML.
